## Use

**post_title**

Create a field with the name 'form_post_title' in your field group, and include your field group in your acf_form() on the front end.

**post_content**

Create a field with the name 'form_post_content' in your field group, and include your field group in your acf_form() on the front end.

**Use predefined field group**

There is a predefined field group provided so that you don't have to worry about adding the title and content to the meta fields in the backend:

```php
acf_form( array(
	'post_id' => 'new_post'
	'field_groups' => array('acf_post-title-content', 42)
) );
```

Where our field group is 'acf_post-title-content' and 42 represents a field group with other meta data for the post.
